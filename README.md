## All the options

alright so now let's talk about the options of this project.
First of all let's talk about the mandatory options:

- Option D1: creates an horizontal histogram in "images" with top 10 drivers by number of routes.
- Option D2: creates an horizontal histogram in "images" with top 10 drivers by number of kilometers traveled.
- Option L: creates a vertical histogram in "images" with top 10 longest routes.
- Option T: creates a grouped histogram in "images" with top 10 cities visited by the routes.
- Option S: creates a graphic  with max/min et average distance per step for 50 routes.
- Option H: prints this help message. It ignores all other options if used.

Now the new options:
- Option D3: creates an horizontal histogram in "images" with last 10 drivers by number of routes.
- Option D4: creates an horizontal histogram in "images" with top 10 drivers by number of kilometers traveled.
- Option W: create a fabulous Welcome text animation.
- Option P: it's an easter egg.
